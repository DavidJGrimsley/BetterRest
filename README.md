# BetterRest
This app is for calculating your bedtime in relation to how many hours of sleep you want and how many cups of coffee you drank.

This app uses the following code features: a custom view modifier turned into an extension for easy access, @State properties, Navigation views, VStacks, Static properties, Forms, Sections, For loops, Navigation titles, Toolbar buttons, error messages, custom functions, machine learning data.
